I'm Poom, a software engineer, indie maker, and community builder from Bangkok, Thailand.

I'm enthusiastic about building indie products, open-source software, civic technologies, creative inter-disciplinary projects, and learning in public. Nice to meet you!

## A little bit about me

- I love building projects with TypeScript, Rust, and React. I'm also learning Kotlin, Elixir and Clojure.
- I like getting my hands dirty in a very wide range of things in computer science and software engineering, from low-level stuff, building compilers, reverse engineering binaries, all the way up to abusing TypeScript's type system to build libraries, architecting frontend applications and backend systems, and building interactive apps. Even if I mainly worked on frontend in my day job, exploring various topics keeps me happy and growing.
- I co-founded [Creatorsgarten](https://creatorsgarten.org), a collective of creators and software engineers with love of hacking, creativity, and interdisciplinary thinking. It's basically a group of friends who likes building things, and exploring different domains! We've organized [50+ hackathons, meetups, events and long-term community projects](https://creatorsgarten.org/events) in Bangkok, Thailand since 2017.
- I dropped out of high school since I was 15 years old to focus on building software, and I've worked in several startups in Thailand and United States since.
- I was the VP of Engineering at Brikl, but I've been focusing on building things. While I can do people/product management, building software and getting deep in computer science is what truly makes me happy.
- I gave ~60 talks on software engineering and learning principles in meetups, conferences and universities.
- I'm a plushie collector, I really love plushies and you will see me carrying plushies everyday. I'll pay for your dinner if you can remember 20 of my plushies' name!
- I enjoy onsen baths, Japanese cuisine, Macarons, swimming in the sea and waterfalls, hiking the mountains, camping, jogging, and jet skiing.
