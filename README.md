I'm Poom, a software engineer, indie maker and community builder from Bangkok, Thailand.

I co-founded @Creatorsgarten, a collective of creators and software engineers with love of hacking, creativity, and interdisciplinary thinking. I dropped out of school when I was in Grade 10, and worked in several startups in Thailand and us. I've organized ~50 events in Thailand, gave ~100 talks on software engineering and learning principles. I love building projects with TypeScript, Rust, and React. I'm also learning Kotlin, Elixir and Clojure.

## Projects

Create machines and connect them together. The bytecode VM and compiler is built in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly, and used in the visual editor built with Reactflow, Nanostores, Radix UI and WASM Bindgen.
