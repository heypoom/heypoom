I'm Poom, a software engineer at day and indie maker at night from Bangkok, Thailand.

I'm enthusiastic about building complex tools and systems, constructivist learning, computer simulations, computer science, and building projects at the inter-disciplinary intersection of technology, creativity, and humanities.

My latest interest is constructionist learning through building simulations, to express yourself through art, and to learn topics such as mathematics and physics through creation.

Nice to meet you!

## A little bit about me

- I'm currently working at [Metabase](https://metabase.com) as a frontend engineer, focusing on [embedded analytics](https://www.metabase.com/product/embedded-analytics-sdk).
- I love building projects with TypeScript, Rust, Svelte and React. I'm also learning Kotlin, Elixir and Clojure. I like to use [these React libraries](https://poom.dev/react-libraries-i-use-2023) for my projects, although I'm switching to Svelte these days for my side projects. I'm primarily a full-stack developer, and I've been writing software professionally for 8+ years.
- I like getting my hands dirty in a very wide range of things in computer science and software engineering, from low-level stuff, building compilers, reverse engineering binaries, all the way up to abusing TypeScript's type system to build libraries, architecting frontend applications and backend systems, and building interactive apps. Even if I primarily worked on frontend development & architecture in my day job, exploring various topics keeps me happy and growing.
- I co-founded [Creatorsgarten](https://creatorsgarten.org), a collective of creators and software engineers with love of hacking, creativity, and interdisciplinary thinking. It's basically a group of friends who likes building things, and exploring different domains! We've organized [50+ hackathons, meetups, events and long-term community projects](https://creatorsgarten.org/events) in Bangkok, Thailand since 2017.
- I dropped out of high school since I was 15 to focus on building software, and I've worked in several startups in Thailand and United States since.
- I was the VP of Engineering, Director of Product and Head of Platform at Brikl, where I explored people and product management in addition to software engineering. While I could do management, I believe coding and building in public is what truly makes me happy.
- I gave ~60 talks on software engineering and learning principles in meetups, conferences and universities.

## My favourites

- I'm a huge plushie lover, I really love my big group of plush friends and you will see me carrying plushies everyday. I'll pay for your dinner if you can remember ten of my plushies' name ;)
- My favourite books are Lifelong Kindergarten, The Computational Beauty of Nature, Godel-Escher-Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, Whiplash, The Hardware Hacker and Never Split the Difference.
- My favourite novels are Three Body Problem series, Neal Stephenson novels (Anathem, Cryptonomicon, The Diamond Age, Snow Crash), the Ender's Game series, and Murakami books.
- My favourite games are heavily modded Minecraft, A Short Hike, A Space for the Unbound, Until Then, Spiritfarer, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, Cult of the Lamb, Journey and GRIS.
- I enjoy onsen baths, Japanese cuisine, Macarons, swimming in the sea and waterfalls, hiking the mountains, camping, jogging, and jet skiing.
